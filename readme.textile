h1. Twitterwall

Is a twitterwall that I created for the barcampcologne3. It just uses html + javascript, so *no* server language like PHP or Ruby is required. Feel free to fork, branch, merge, whatever.

h1. Install

Get it from github through git or download. Start index.html with browser.

h1. Configuration

Edit the index.html and change the initial keyword for

<pre>
query_string = "bcc3";
</pre>

h1. Usage

Press the ALT-key for a popup menu where you can configure the searchquery and the width of the container (to adjust size realtime for beamers).
